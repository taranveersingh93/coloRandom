# ColoRandom 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The ColoRandom app allows users to create, save, and customize random color palettes for their design needs.
 - Users can click on the new palette button to generate randomized palettes and have the ability to lock individual colors within the palette. 
 - Any further randomizations would not change the locked boxes. 
 - Users can save palettes with the save button and reload a saved palette to the main palette, upon click, to edit. 
 - Saved palettes cannot be duplicated. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

2. Clone down to your desired directory by commanding 
  `git clone git@github.com:taranveersingh93/coloRandom.git`
3. cd into the repository
4. View the project in the browser by running `open index.html` in your terminal

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

- Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage functions, creating and using an effective data model
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Refine your collaboration skills


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
#### Wins
- Learning to read and interpret other collaborators' coding style.
- Improving our git workflow so all collaborators have the same understanding of the status of our project. 
- Implementing a cohesive use of data model and DOM.
- Utilizing event delegation and bubbling to have efficient event listeners and non repeating functions.

#### Challenges
- Dealing with nested data but conquered the challenge by consistently using console.log to guide us.
- Creating functions initially had unintended side effects in terms of the data model that got affected. We resolved this by striving for pure functions where applicable and isolating the functions. This avoided any unwanted changes to our global variables. 
- Naming our variables and functions was a challenge at first, but we conciously decided what the function or variable was doing and kept the naming consistent accordingly.
